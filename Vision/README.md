A New Focus for the W3C: Improving the Web’s Integrity

# Our vision for the World-Wide Web
The World Wide Web was conceived more than 25 years ago as a tool for sharing information. It has become much more than that; it is a fundamental part of the lives of much of humanity, enabling access to information, education, commerce and shopping, social experiences, civic functions, entertainment, and more. 

The Web is a force for good; indeed, it has catalyzed major social changes. At the same time, the Web's phenomenal success has led to many unintended consequences that inflict significant distress on society: openness and anonymity enable scams, phishing, and fraud. Ease of gathering personal information spawned business models that mined and sold detailed user behaviors, without people’s awareness or consent. The acceleration of global information sharing enabled misinformation to flourish, to be exploited for political or commercial gain, divide societies, and to incite hate.  We must do better.  We must take steps to address these unintended consequences in the standards we develop.

Technology is not neutral; new technologies facilitate new actions, and enable new possibilities. We are proud of the good enabled by our web technologies; we will take the responsibility to use our values both to assess the potential and actual impact of our work (especially harms caused by that work), and to optimize these technologies throughout their lifecycles.

Our vision is for a World Wide Web that is more inclusive, and more respectful of its users: a Web that supports truth better than falsehood, people more than profits, humanity rather than hate.

We will improve the fundamental integrity of the Web platform. The Web will not only grow in scope and importance in our lives; it will grow in respect for its users, grow in the trust of its users, grow in its inclusion of all humanity as its users.

Our new vision is built on these twin pillars:

* Our existing pillar, on which we built the web: the enormous potential of technological change.
* Our new pillar for the years ahead: recognition and embodiment of fundamental values into the architecture of the web.

## Vision
What we envision web to be?

One interoperable worldwide web, accessible and safe for everyone, good for the humanity; Implements a unified, extensible web architecture which continues to address the evolving user’s needs.

## Purpose
Why do we (W3C organization) exist?

Develop the open web architecture and global standards for web technologies by bringing diverse voices from around the world and industries together, incubate and build industry wide consensus.

## Mission
(Highlighting the main focus on ethical values)

Embed the ethical values in the Web platform while growing the web in the scope and the importance in everyone’s life.

## Ethical values
(The values which we intend to embed in the web)
* Is trustworthy, ensures security and privacy for users.
* Works for everyone, striving for diversity and inclusion of participants from different geographical locations, cultures, languages, accessibility needs, gender identities, and more. Continue to champion accessibility and internationalization as one of the core principles for the Web.
* Puts the needs of users first: above authors, publishers, implementers, paying W3C Members, or theoretical purity.
* Does not favor centralization.
* Is based on standards that are openly developed with consensus of industry and key stakeholders, standards rooted in a strong royalty-free patent policy and open copyright licenses, focused on interoperability and collective empowerment.
* Encourages equity and fairness and prevents dominance by any person, company or interest group.

## Goals for achieving the mission
### Worldwide participation, diversity and inclusion
* Strive for the broadest participation, along axes including worldwide participation, diversity and inclusion, and thus establishing W3C as representative of the worldwide community. 
* Foster balance, equity and cooperation among the participants from different industries, user groups and organizational sizes.
* Ensure transparency, equity and fairness. Our work should not exclusively be dominated by any person, company or interest group.

### Evolution of the web platform
* Evolve the extensible web architecture to empower industries and individuals to address the evolving user’s needs.
* Encourage incubation in new areas and industries with open platforms for discussion, collaboration and innovation, making it more structured and improving consensus-building among key stake holders.

### Social values
* The efforts on accessibility and internationalization should continue to achieve the goal of a Web for everyone.
* The evolving Web platform and Web technologies should improve in integrity, security and privacy. We should revisit the current Web platform and explore how we can responsibly improve personal privacy for users.

### Collaborations with key entities
* Establish and improve collaborative relationships with other organizations in the domain of Internet and Web standards, including building and maintaining respected relationships with governments and businesses for providing credible advice.

## Our Operating principles
(These are derived from ethical values and open standards principles)
* Diversity and inclusion
* Trust: integrity, privacy and security
* Web should be good for humanity
* Openness and Interoperability
* Users first
* Balance and non-ownership (Standards activities are not exclusively dominated by any particular person, company or interest group, and we should continue ensure royalty free contributions)
* Due process. Decisions are made with equity and fairness 
* Transparency
* Broad Consensus 
* Collaboration and cooperation (among the members as well as with other standards organizations)
* Collective empowerment.
